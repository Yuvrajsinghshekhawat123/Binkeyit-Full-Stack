/*
ðŸ”¹ 1. LocalStorage (manual use)
    . You directly use browserâ€™s API:
            localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(user));
          const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"));
    .You have to manually save, update, and remove data each time something changes.
    .No automatic sync with Redux.
    . If your Redux state updates, localStorage does not automatically update â€” you must write extra cod

  


ðŸ”¹ 2. redux-persist (with whitelist)
      . Built on top of localStorage (or sessionStorage, IndexedDB, etc.).
      . Automatically:
          . Saves slices (reducers) to storage whenever they change.
          . Restores them into Redux store after a refresh.
      . You can control which slices are persisted with:
          .whitelist: only save specific slices
          .blacklist: save everything except listed slices

      . Handles rehydration (loading persisted state back into Redux on app startup).
